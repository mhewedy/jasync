# JAsync

JAsync provides `async` and `await` functions in Java (8+) based on `CompletableFuture`.

The idea is very basic, `async` and `await` are wrappers on `CompletableFuture`'s methods to give a convenient way to
call multiple long-running processes and wait for execution at the end.

>NOTE: It is differnt from Javascript async/await where in JS the code suspended until the result returned, but here a thread is handling the call(s) and then we block and wait for the result at the end.

It integrates with spring framework (but don't require it). so if you need to run the async tasks on a
Spring `TaskExecutor`, you need to define a bean of type `TaskExecutor` with the name `jasyncTaskExecutor`

## Install
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.github.mhewedy</groupId>
  <artifactId>jasync</artifactId>
  <version>0.0.3</version>
</dependency>
```

## Example

1. Invoke functions and doesn't expect result:

```java
Promise<?> p1 = Task.async(this::callLongRunningFunction1);
Promise<?> p2 = Task.async(this::callLongRunningFunction2);

// ... other code here ...

// and at the last:
Task.await(p1, p2);
```

2. Invoke functions and expects result:

```java
Promise<String> p1 = Task.async(this::callLongRunningFunction1);
Promise<String> p2 = Task.async(this::callLongRunningFunction2);

// ... other code here ...

// and at the last:
String resutl1 = Task.await(p1);
String resutl2 = Task.await(p2);
```

> NOTE: It is different from Javascript async await. it when multiple async operation cascaded, you need to wait for the first before invoke the second.
